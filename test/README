#This package shows an example of use of the RootAnalysis code.
# A simple TTree with a single objects is read, and histograms for the
#two leafs of the TTree are made.
#The test data file is created with makeTestData.cxx run from ROOT commandline.
#
# > root
# root [0] .x makeTestData.cxx
#
#The example can be run with following command:
# test.ini file contains path to the data files, and number of concurent threads to be used during
# analysis

./test test.ini

#Resulting plots are aved into fig_png directory.
#The test.ini file confiures the data path, and number of events to be read.
#Negative number of events means take all the events from data file
#
#Adapatation to different analysis requires following modifications:
#
# 1) Adaptation of the EventProxyTest.* files.
#    The EventProxyTest class defines the data structure of the analysis
# 2) Definition of histograms ofthe analysis in TestHistograms.cc     
#    The recommented way is to define a histogram template with name "h1DSomeNameTemplate"
#    Later all histograms of name "h1DSomeNameSomethingElse" will use the "h1DSomeNameTemplate"
#    as template. The TestHistograms also takes care of plotting and saving histograms to png file.
#    See finalize() method
# 3) Adapt the main analysis class: TestAnalyzer
#    The event selection, and histogram filling is handled in TestAnalyzer.cc file
#
